# @pkmn/sets

[![npm version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/@pkmn/data.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@pkmn/data)&nbsp;

A forked implementation of [smogon/pokemon-showdown-client][0]'s data layer, with minor differences:

- learnsets data is `async`
- `Dex` and `ModdedDex` behave more similarly to their server side counterparts
- there is an alternative entrypoint named `Generations` which provides difference semantics around
  existence and legality
