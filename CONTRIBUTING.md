Please read through the index [README](README.md), the READMEs the index links to, and
[pkmn.cc/@pkmn](https://pkmn.cc/@pkmn/) for general information about `@pkmn/ps` about development
on `@pkmn` projects respectively. When opening issues or pull requests, please use one of the
existing templates and fill them out to the best of your ability. Pull requests are unlikely to be
merged without tests, but it is fine to open a pull request without tests for feedback or to ask for
help with testing. :)

Contributing to this project is relatively difficult as it depends on having a strong working
knowledge of how Pokémon Showdown works as well as the infrastructure and processes involved in
importing, repackaging, and releasing the code. Furthermore, in many cases you will be directed to
instead submit code upstream to Pokémon Showdown itself instead.
